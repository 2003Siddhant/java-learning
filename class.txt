procedure oriented proggraming:

object oriented proggraming:

class is a blueprint . object are the real values
new keyword is the builder which takes class as a blueprint and build a house for objects.
new keyword allocates memory and initializes object based on class

Car c = new Car();

-> Car: class name
c: referencce variable
new : new keyword // its a java keyword used to instantialte a class
Car() : constructor call

this:=>
--> The this keyword in Java refers to the current object of a class.
1) Differentiate between instance variables and parameters
When constructor or method parameters have the same name as instance variables, this clarifies which one you mean

2)You can use this to explicitly call another method in the same class.
ex: void show(){...}
void display() {this.show()}

3)this() can be used to call another constructor in the same class (constructor chaining).


# Static:=>
-> it belongs tp the class and not the individual instances. shared among all the instances of class.
-> if we dont write static keyword then we have to create object of the class to acces there methods. with static keyword we can directly call the class methods.
can be calles without creating object of the class
-> we create main method as static because we dont want JVM to create object of the class. we want jvm to directly call the class.

#constructor:=>
-> it should have same name as class
-> it should not have a return type, not even void
-> it is automatically called when instance of the class is created.

#Stack and Heap:=>
stack: orderrd on top of each other
->here method invocations and local variables live
->method calling happens in call stack
-> it is a static memory allocation
ex: go(),drive(),main()
-> object goes tos  heap and referencce goes to stack.

heap: no ordering
-> all the objects live each other
ex: obj,a,b stores object and arrays
-> it has a dynamic memoery allocation at runtime

primitives: where i dont need to go to heap , dont need to make object
memory is declared directly in compile time
ex: int char float boolean

non primitives: we have to create its object which is inside heap
ex: class arr interface object
- Memory: Variables store a reference (pointer) to an object in the heap.

#garbageCollection:=>
-> garbageCollector colects all the object which are of no use which is basically deallocating the memory
-> its an automatic process

-- if there are no referencces in stack which points to that particular object which means that object is present in am address which no one knows
thus JVM collects such type of objects inside the heap.

-- java uses generational garbageCollection strategy which dividws memoery into diffrent regions based on object ages(old,young,permanent).

finalize: before an object is beign garbageCollected finalize() method mat be called giving an object a chance to clean up resources.
