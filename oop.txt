Encapsulation : when an object only exposes the selected information.
-> basically keeping mathods and variables in a single class.
a) data hiding: hides internal data, access only through methods.
b)access modifiers like public,private,protected.
c) has getters and setters.

ex: theres only minor difference between Encapsulation and abstraction is that abstraction only hides internal working of suppose switch but shows switch,while Encapsulation hides both switchand its implementation or working details.

abstraction : Hides complex details to refuce complexity.

Inheritance : entities can inherit attributes from other entities.

Polymorphism : entities can have more than one form.

Access modifiers: 
public: can be accessed from anywhere class and packages.
private:restrict access within class only.
protected:allows access within same package and subclasses.
default: allows access within same package.
