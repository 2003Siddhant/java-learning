Encapsulation : when an object only exposes the selected information.
-> basically keeping mathods and variables in a single class.
a) data hiding: hides internal data, access only through methods.
b)access modifiers like public,private,protected.
c) has getters and setters.

ex: theres only minor difference between Encapsulation and abstraction is that abstraction only hides internal working of suppose switch but shows switch,while Encapsulation hides both switchand its implementation or working details.

abstraction : Hides complex details to refuce complexity.

Inheritance : entities can inherit attributes from other entities.

Polymorphism : entities can have more than one form.

Access modifiers: 
public: can be accessed from anywhere class and packages.
private:restrict access within class only.
protected:allows access within same package and subclasses.
default: allows access within same package.

getters and setters:
always used to retreive private field values.
allow for internal changes without affecting external interfaces.

Inheritance:child class inherits properties of parent class.
-> single : once child and one parent
-> multiple: two parent class having a single child or child inherits properties of both the parent class. (java doesnt support it basically).
-> multilevel:parent have a child. that child have an another child. like
(parent) vehicle ->(child of vehicle) twoWheller ->(child of twoWheller) Motor
-> hierarchial: parent class has 2 child and there is a hierarchy between child and parent.


object class: its the parent of all the classes in java, basically top hierarchy.
-> provides mrhtods like hashcode(), tostring() , equals().
